Using the  MVC system in Sencha Ext 4.0 to prototype an app with the following  characteristics:
 - Has a data model with many-to-many associations (in this case, categories have many reports and vice versa)
 - Has a hierarchical data model (in this case, categories contain categories)
 - Displays the hierarchical data model in a tree with collapsible nodes
 - Uses HTML5 History and URI hash fragments to make each category state bookmarkable

 I require Ext 4.0 to be in a peer directory named 'extjs'.  You can change this location if you modify a few paths in
 index.html, such as <script src="../extjs/ext-debug.js"></script>
