This is a prototype of an MVC application in Sencha Ext 4.0.  It has the following characteristics:
 - Has a data model with many-to-many associations (in this case, categories have many reports and vice versa)
 - Has a hierarchical data model (in this case, categories contain categories)
 - Displays the hierarchical data model in a tree with collapsible nodes
 - Uses HTML5 History and URI hash fragments to make each category state bookmarkable

 You must download Ext 4.0 from the Sencha website and install it into a peer directory named 'extjs'.  
You can change this location if you modify a few paths in index.html, such as <script src="../extjs/ext-debug.js"></script>
